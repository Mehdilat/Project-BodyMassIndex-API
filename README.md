In this project, the ["500 Person Gender-Height-Weight-Body Mass Index"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yersever/500-person-gender-height-weight-bodymassindex) dataset available on Kaggle is utilized, encompassing data from 500 individuals, categorized by gender, height, and weight. The objective is to employ this dataset to train and evaluate various machine learning models based on their accuracy. The highest-performing model is then integrated into a Flask Application Programming Interface (API). This API is containerized using Docker, ensuring a seamless deployment process, and is subsequently hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The deployed model is accessible at the following URL: [http://35.180.164.45:5000/](http://35.180.164.45:5000/).
